I created this script to help design floors in building and choose what type of joists to use based on loading requirements. 
Run the script in the python shell, and then call the functions with your design parameters to see if those parameters are acceptable and will not fail.

The joist span table comes from here: https://www.mycarpentry.com/joist-span-table.html
